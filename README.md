# 👋 Welcome

I’m **Amin Ziagham** — a **Software Engineer** with over **15 years of professional experience** designing and building robust software systems.

🚀 I started programming at **17**, and since then, engineering has been more than a career — it’s been a lifelong passion.

🎯 I’m a proud member of the **.NET Foundation**, actively supporting and contributing to the open-source ecosystem.

🤖 Currently, I’m expanding my expertise into **AI Engineering**, focusing on AI, machine learning, and intelligent system design.

## 🧠 What I Do Best

I specialize in building:

* 🏗 **Scalable & Maintainable Architectures**
* 🧩 **Clean, Elegant, and Testable Codebases**
* 📊 **Mathematical Optimization Models**
* ⚙️ **Algorithmically Efficient Systems**
* 🤖 **AI & ML–Driven Solutions**

My engineering philosophy combines **clean architecture principles**, **mathematical rigor**, and **modern cloud-native practices** to deliver systems that are not only functional — but **refined and future-ready**.

I’m detail-oriented, self-driven, and deeply committed to mastering emerging technologies.

## ☁️ Microsoft Certifications

I hold multiple Microsoft Azure certifications within the .NET and cloud ecosystem:

* **Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)**
* **Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)**
* **Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate (AZ-204)**

These certifications validate my expertise in:

* Cloud Architecture & Infrastructure
* Azure-native Application Development
* DevOps & Deployment Strategies
* Secure & Scalable System Design

## 🌱 Open Source: GenoFlow

**[GenoFlow](https://github.com/genoflow/genoflow)** is my open-source initiative focused on:

> **Bio-Inspired Workflow Automation & Evolutionary Computation**

It merges optimization theory, adaptive systems, and modern engineering practices to explore next-generation workflow orchestration.

## 💡 Engineering Philosophy

I believe in:

* Open-source collaboration
* Continuous learning & experimentation
* Mathematical precision in software design
* AI-enhanced decision systems
* Writing code that is clean, intentional, and elegant

My goal is simple:

> Build systems that are scalable, intelligent, and architecturally sound — while continuously evolving as an engineer.
