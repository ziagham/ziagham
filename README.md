# 👋 Welcome

My name is **Amin Ziagham**, a **Software Engineer** with over **15 years of professional experience** in software design and development. I began programming at **age 17**, which sparked my lifelong passion for building software and solving complex problems. I am currently **learning AI engineering**, expanding my expertise into artificial intelligence, machine learning, and intelligent system design.  

I specialize in **building scalable, maintainable, and high-quality software systems** using principles of **clean architecture** and **elegant coding practices**. My expertise spans **Mathematical Optimization, System Architectures, Algorithmic Problem Solving**, and now **AI/ML-driven solutions**. I am **detail-oriented, self-driven**, and passionate about exploring and adapting to new technologies and engineering concepts.  

## Microsoft Certifications

I hold multiple **Microsoft Azure certifications**, validating my proficiency in cloud solutions and development within the **.NET ecosystem**:  

- [**Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/AminZiagham/D685BF5239F0084A?sharingId=FBCFF8F3F0CB5277)  
- [**Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/AminZiagham/C404DAA9350C528C?sharingId=FBCFF8F3F0CB5277)  
- [**Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate (AZ-204)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-us/AminZiagham/653AB46A1AC801A9?sharingId=FBCFF8F3F0CB5277)  

These credentials have strengthened my knowledge in **cloud architecture, deployment strategies, and DevOps integration**.  

## Open-Source Project: FlowSynx

**[FlowSynx](https://github.com/flowsynx/flowsynx)** is my open-source initiative focused on **workflow automation and orchestration** through a **JSON-based DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) execution model**.  

FlowSynx simplifies **complex workflow processing** with a **modular, plugin-based architecture** and **visual workflow representation**. Key features include:  

- **.NET-based workflow engine**  
- **Clean Architecture implementation**  
- **Blazor-based GUI**  
- **Built-in authentication and security**  

The project embodies my vision of creating **intelligent, extensible, and human-readable workflow systems** for **modern distributed applications**, now increasingly integrating **AI and intelligent automation concepts**.  

## Philosophy

I embrace an **open-source–driven approach** emphasizing **collaboration, transparency, and adaptability**. My approach integrates **mathematical programming, algorithmic problem-solving, and AI-driven insights** to develop **robust, scalable, and elegant software solutions**. I prioritize **continuous learning, experimentation, and knowledge sharing**, striving to contribute meaningfully to both the projects I work on and the broader engineering community.  

⭐ _“Applying mathematical optimization, principled software architecture, and AI-driven solutions, continuously learning, and delivering clean, efficient systems are at the core of everything I do.”_
